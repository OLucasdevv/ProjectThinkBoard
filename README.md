🧠 ThinkBoard

ThinkBoard is my first project and it is a feedback and idea-sharing platform designed to help teams or communities collect, organize, and discuss improvement ideas in an intuitive way.  
It allows users to submit their thoughts, categorize them, and vote on what matters most — all in a clean, minimal interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 **Submit Ideas** — Users can create new feedback cards by adding a **title**, **description**, and **category** (e.g., *Organization*, *Performance*, etc.).
- 🗳️ **Voting System** — Each idea can be **upvoted or downvoted** by other users to highlight popular suggestions.
- 🧩 **Category Organization** — Filter and explore ideas by category.
- 🧭 **Sidebar & Navbar** — Custom sidebar and navigation bar for smooth and clean browsing.
- 💾 **Local Storage / Database Ready** — Currently runs with local state, but ready for database integration.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** — Simple, dark-themed layout with a focus on usability and minimalism.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React.js (Vite)** — Frontend framework for fast, modular development.  
- **CSS3** — For custom styling (no Tailwind).  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Application logic and state management.  
- **(Optional)** Database integration planned for future updates.
